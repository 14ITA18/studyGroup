Study Groups
============

Welcome to [Mozilla Science Lab](http://www.mozillascience.org/)'s Study Group project! From here, we'll set you up with everything you need to start your own study group.

### Wait What's a 'Study Group'

Study groups are fun, informal meetups of your friends and colleagues from around your local institution or town to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers.

## How to Set Up Your own Study Group Website

Everything you need to set up your own study group website for organizing events is right here - follow the following steps and you'll be up and running soon:

 1. **Make yourself an account on GitHub.** The free one is just fine - we're not going to do anything fancy.
 2. **Fork this repository.** Up in the top right corner, there's a button that says 'Fork'; press it! This makes your very own copy of all this stuff in your own space on GitHub; you can go visit your new repo at `https://github.com/yourUserName/studyGroup`, where `yourUserName` is whatever user name you chose when you signed up for GitHub.
 3. **Edit the `_config.yml` file** in your new repository. To do this, click on `_config.yml`, then click on the little pencil neat the top right. There are instructions right in the file on how to edit it. When you're done, press the big green 'Commit Changes' button at the bottom of the page.

That's it, you're done! You can see your new website at `http://yourUserName.github.io/studyGroup/`, where `yourUserName` is the same username you used above.
